üì± App Analysis with Power BI
This repository contains a team project completed as part of the Value-Added Course conducted by BYTS Technology at E.G.S. Pillay Engineering College, under the B.Tech ‚Äì Artificial Intelligence and Data Science program.

Team Leader: Darshana
Guide: Mr. Mohammed Danish

üìå Project Overview
Our project focuses on analyzing mobile app data using Power BI and Python (for preprocessing). We built an interactive Power BI dashboard that helps visualize app performance trends ‚Äî including:

App categories

User ratings

Number of reviews

Install counts

Pricing and content ratings

This end-to-end project involved dataset cleaning, transformation, and storytelling with data visualizations.

üõ† Tools & Technologies
Python (Google Colab)

Microsoft Power BI

Google Drive (for data sharing)

Pandas & NumPy (for preprocessing)
